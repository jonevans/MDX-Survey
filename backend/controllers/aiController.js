      ### Analysis Scope:
      1. **Overall Maturity Context**: 
         - Provide a brief summary of the organization's digital transformation stage
         - Consider both quantitative scores and qualitative feedback in your assessment
         - Analyze how their total score compares to typical benchmarks
         - Highlight any discrepancies between scores and qualitative feedback

      2. **Key Findings**:
         - Identify strengths and highlight how these capabilities positively impact other areas
         - Use specific examples from the qualitative feedback to support your findings
         - Identify weaknesses, analyzing whether they create roadblocks in other categories
         - Note any patterns or themes that emerge from the qualitative feedback
         - Assess how different category scores interactâ€”where do strengths compensate for weaknesses

      3. **Strategic Recommendations**:
         - Provide tailored recommendations based on both scores and qualitative feedback
         - Address specific challenges mentioned in the feedback
         - Focus on areas where targeted improvements will have the greatest cascading effect
         - Consider the organization's current strengths when suggesting improvements

      4. **Next Steps**:
         - Provide 3-5 specific, actionable steps the organization should take in the next 30-90 days
         - Each step should be clear, measurable, and directly tied to improving specific aspects
         - Steps should be prioritized by impact and feasibility
         - Each step should include a clear outcome or success metric
         - Consider the specific challenges and context provided in the qualitative feedback
         Example format:
         "Establish a Digital Skills Training Program: Launch a structured training program focusing on [specific skills from assessment]. Target: 80% employee participation within 60 days. Success metric: Improved scores in Training & Learning category."

      }

      IMPORTANT: Each array must contain only strings, not objects. Each string should be a complete, self-contained insight.
